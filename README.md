**CodeVerse**

A Java-based web based tech blog sharing application designed to demonstrate clean architecture and modular development with Servlets, JSP, and MySQL. This project focuses on implementing a scalable backend structure, separating concerns into multiple packages (dao, entities, servlets, helper) for maintainability.

**About the project**

CodeVerse is a Java full-stack blogging platform designed to share and read the latest technology updates worldwide. It features a clean blue-and-white UI with a structured navigation bar for easy access to Home, Contact, Sign Up, and Login pages. Users can explore blog previews and view full posts after logging in or signing up, with secure authentication and duplicate email checks in place. Once logged in, users can filter blogs by category, interact through likes, dislikes, and comments, and even publish their own posts. Profile management, editing options, and logout functionality are provided, while comments are powered by the Disqus plugin with email authentication for a more engaging experience.
